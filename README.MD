# Jamie worshiper

This bot was created with the sole purpose of worshipping jamie.

The bot is now ported to c#

You can download it and use it for yourself, an official version will always be hosted, you can invite it with [This link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=976181110390284418&permissions=414531832896&scope=bot%20applications.commands)

## Self usage

The bot will automatically create the required databases with some default values for the actual official bot status i recommend you change.

### Configuration
All the configuration is stored in the SQLITE Database for a future command i'm planning to write,
being like this the configuration is not finished and so some values are hard coded (plan to change)

### Env variables
The bot also requires a .env file to be created in the compiled folder with the following keys/values

| Key        | Value description                                                        |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| MODERATORS | All the bot moderators discord ID's separated with commas without spaces |
| TOKEN      | Your discord bot token                                                   |
| GITCREDS   | Your GitHub credentials for the bot status command                       |

### Releases

Since the configuration is not yet finished, no releases will be published until then, the first release requires the bot to be fully configurable trough commands, which is not right now.

## Thanks

And keep worshipping jamie (he deserves it)
